Alumni Awards Student Banquet First Request Email 

Good afternoon changemakers!

Homecoming week is nearly here and we have a special opportunity just for

you. Park University is hosting its Annual Awards Luncheon (Friday, Sept.

16th from 11:30 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. at the Black on Burrlington) and we want YOU to attend. We are looking for 20 of your shining faces who would like to ride the provided bus, mingle with recent alumni, get a FREE lunch, and connect with your university in a unique way!

The bus leaves at 11:15am from the Park Alumni House. If you are

interested, please respond to this email and let me know. 

Keep making Park University great,

Ben
