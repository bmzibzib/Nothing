Background: 

Turnitin is an electronic text matching system that compares text in a student assignment against a database of sources. The database contains copies of electronic text on the Internet, in published works, on commercial databases, and in assignments previously submitted to Turnitin by students in universities all over the world, including assignments obtained from internet sites that sell student papers.Turnitin provides an Originality Report in which 'matched' text is underlined, colour coded, and linked to either the original source or a similar document on its database. The report also provides an indication of the proportion of the submitted work that matches other sources, this is the Similarity Index. It is important to be aware that Curtin does NOT define a 'safe' level for the Similarity Index nor is there a level that signals that plagiarism has occurred. The evaluation of plagiarism is an academic process that takes into account the evidence within the context of the specific assignment.Turnitin provides a means of strengthening the implementation of the University's policy on academic integrity. Turnitin is one of many resources that can help ensure that academic integrity is maintained. Teaching staff have multiple ways of detecting plagiarism and are normally very familiar with the academic reference sources within their discipline. Turnitin quickly identifies the source of matching text and this assists in the decision making process, thereby helping support the maintenance of fair assessment standards for all students.

**I was unable to find a contract for your service renewal, but if this is something you'd like to pursue I can work on that for you though it's important to know that it won't likely be complete through all the channels prior to the extended service date so it may best to work a contract as a separate line item.  If you don't wish to pursue a contract we can work as we've done previously by having you send us a PO for the next renewal period (see attached quote).**

**Once you are ready with your PO we will work on coordinating the training plan and dates.  Please send the PO to me directly so I may expedite it for you before the service extension date of 1/28/17.  I added this extra time to prevent disruption of service while we tend to the business side of things.  Note that we have a new mailing address so I've also included a new W-9.**
